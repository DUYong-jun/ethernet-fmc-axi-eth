====================

Example design for the [Quad Gigabit Ethernet FMC](http://ethernetfmc.com "Ethernet FMC") on ALL the Xilinx Series-7 Evaluation boards using 4 AXI Ethernet blocks

### Supported boards

* Artix-7 [AC701 Evaluation board](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-a7-ac701-g.html "AC701 Evaluation board")
  * HPC connector (use ac701.xdc)
* Kintex-7 [KC705 Evaluation board](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-k7-kc705-g.html "KC705 Evaluation board")
  * LPC connector (use kc705-lpc.xdc)
  * HPC connector (use kc705-hpc.xdc)
* Virtex-7 [VC707 Evaluation board](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-v7-vc707-g.html "VC707 Evaluation board")
  * HPC connector 1 (use vc707-hpc1.xdc)
  * HPC connector 2 (use vc707-hpc2.xdc)
* Virtex-7 [VC709 Evaluation board](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/dk-v7-vc709-g.html "VC709 Evaluation board")
  * HPC connector (use vc709.xdc)
* Zynq-7000 [ZC702 Evaluation board](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-z7-zc702-g.html "ZC702 Evaluation board")
  * LPC connector 1 (use zc702-lpc1.xdc)
  * LPC connector 2 (use zc702-lpc2.xdc)
* Zynq-7000 [ZC706 Evaluation board](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-z7-zc706-g.html "ZC706 Evaluation board") (LPC only)
  * LPC connector (use zc706-lpc.xdc)

### Not-supported

* Zynq-7000 [ZC706 Evaluation board](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-z7-zc706-g.html "ZC706 Evaluation board") (HPC)
  * HPC connector: Pins LA18_CC and LA17_CC of the HPC connector are routed to non-clock-capable pins so they cannot
  properly receive the RGMII receive clocks for ports 2 and 3 of the Ethernet FMC. The constraints file zc706-hpc.xdc is
  provided for reference, however it will not pass compilation with the Xilinx tools due to this problem.

### Description

This project demonstrates the use of the Opsero [Quad Gigabit Ethernet FMC](http://ethernetfmc.com "Ethernet FMC").
The design contains 4 AXI Ethernet blocks configured with DMAs.

> Note: Zynq PS block is replaced by MicroBlaze processor for the Artix, Kintex and Virtex boards.

### Requirements

* Vivado 2014.4 (see Library modifications below)
* [Ethernet FMC](http://ethernetfmc.com "Ethernet FMC")
* One of the above listed evaluation boards
* [Xilinx Soft TEMAC license](http://ethernetfmc.com/getting-a-license-for-the-xilinx-tri-mode-ethernet-mac/ "Xilinx Soft TEMAC license")

### Library modifications for Vivado 2014.4

To use this project, a modification must be made to the lwIP libraries
provided by the Xilinx SDK. The modification can be made either to the
BSP code of your SDK workspace, or to the SDK sources. I personally
recommend modifying the SDK sources as every rebuild of the BSP results
in the BSP sources being overwritten with the SDK sources.

#### Modification to xaxiemacif_dma.c 

Open the following file:

`C:\Xilinx\SDK\2014.4\data\embeddedsw\ThirdParty\sw_services\lwip140_v2_2\src\contrib\ports\xilinx\netif\xaxiemacif_dma.c`

Replace this line of code:

`DMAConfig = XAxiDma_LookupConfig(XPAR_AXIDMA_0_DEVICE_ID);`

With this one:

`DMAConfig = XAxiDma_LookupConfig(xemac->topology_index);`

### License

Feel free to modify the code for your specific application.

### Fork and share

If you port this project to another hardware platform, please send me the
code or push it onto GitHub and send me the link so I can post it on my
website. The more people that benefit, the better.
